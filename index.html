            <h1>Measuring Happiness?</h1>
            <p>
              Happiness, as a concept is <b>subjective.</b><br>
              <br> 
              As a result, we have resorted to using <span style="color:blue"><b>The World Happiness Index</b></span> to measure happiness. <br>
              <br>
              The graph to the right is a visualization of the <span style="color:blue"><b>World Happiness Index</b></span> for the year 2018. <br>
              <br>
              (note: there are a few countries missing from the graph due to lack of data.)

            <h1>Measuring Crime?</h1>
            <p>
              Crime, however, can be easily measured based on the <b>number of cases per year.</b><br>
              <br>
              <span style="color: red;"><b>The World Crime Index</b></span>, comes in handy as it accurately measured the amount of crime<br>
              committed by each country. <br>
              <br>
              As such, the graph to the left is a visualization of the <span style="color:red"><b>World Crime Index</b></span> for the year 2018. <br>
              <br>

              <br>
              As we can observe, the happiness countries are usually found on the lower ends of the crime rate graph.<br>

              It's evident that there is an <b>indirect correlation.</b><br>

              However, is there more to the story?

        <h2>Other Factors Affecting Happiness</h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to happiness, it's not just about crime. Other important things include:<br>
        </br>
        <b><span style="color:darkblue">Freedom to Make Choices:</span></b> People are happier when they can decide how they want to live their lives.<br>
        <br>
        <b><span style="color:darkorange">Corruption Perceptions:</span></b> Trust in government and institutions affects happiness. Less corruption means more happiness.<br>
        <br>
        <b><span style="color:darkred">Social Support:</span></b> Having friends and family who care about you makes a big difference in how happy you feel.<br>
        <br>  
        These factors show that happiness is about more than just having a good income. It's also about freedom, trust, and the people in your life.<br>
        <br>

        <h2>Impact of GDP and Life Expectancy on Happiness</h2>
        <p>
          <b><span style="color:rgb(27, 170, 27)">Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita</span></b> serves as a measure of economic prosperity and access to resources within a country.<br>
          Countries with higher <b><span style="color:rgb(27, 170, 27)">GDP per capita</span></b> tend to have better <b>infrastructure, education, and healthcare,</b> all of which contribute to an improved <b>quality of life.</b><br>  
          <br>
          <b><span style="color:darkblue">Life expectancy</span></b> is a key indicator of a nation's overall health and well-being.<br>
          Longer <b><span style="color:darkblue">life expectancy</span></b> often correlates with a better <b>healthcare system, lifestyle, and social support,</b> all of which are linked to higher levels of <b>happiness</b>. <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <!-- Embed GDP bubble plot -->
        <div id="gdp_bubbleplot"></div>
        <p>As we can see from this graph that plots <b><span style="color:rgb(27, 170, 27)">GDP per capita</span> and <span style="color:darkblue">Life Expectancy</span></b>, we can observe that the lower the <b><span style="color:rgb(27, 170, 27)">GDP per capita</span> and <br>
          <span style="color:darkblue">life Expectancy</span></b>, the lower the levels of <b>happiness.</b><br>
        <br>
        The countries with overall lower <b><span style="color:rgb(27, 170, 27)">GDP </span> + <span style="color:darkblue">Life Expectancy</span></b> rank around an average of <b>3 to 4 on the happiness score</b>, while <br>
        the countries with overall higher <b><span style="color:rgb(27, 170, 27)">GDP</span> + <span style="color:darkblue">Life Expectancy</span></b> rank around an average of <b>6 to 7 on the happiness score.</b><br>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, while crime undeniably affects happiness by instilling fear and insecurity, it is just one piece of a complex puzzle. Economic prosperity, good health, freedom, trust, and social connections all play vital roles in shaping a happier society. Addressing and improving these interconnected aspects holistically is key to fostering overall well-being and happiness in communities.
